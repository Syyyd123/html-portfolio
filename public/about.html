<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Syyd, a passionate and detail-oriented Business Analyst 
  with nearly two years of experience across the edtech and design 
  industries. My journey began in an edtech startup, where I honed 
  my skills in analyzing user data and translating complex requirements
  into actionable Product Requirement Documents (PRDs). Currently, 
  I’m diving into the dynamic world of marketing CRMs, collaborating 
  with cross-functional teams to implement advanced personalization, 
  automation, and lead attribution strategies.
</p>

<p>I thrive in roles where I can bridge 
  the gap between business goals and technical solutions. 
  With a focus on enhancing user experiences, I’ve worked on 
  projects like the Student Development Program (SDP) and marketing 
  CRM initiatives, ensuring that each system aligns seamlessly with user 
  needs. My work involves crafting efficient workflows, integrating AI 
  capabilities, and driving data-driven decisions that empower teams to 
  achieve measurable results.
</p>

<p>Outside of work, I’m deeply 
  invested in fitness and personal 
  growth. Whether it’s crafting the 
  perfect gym playlist, exploring creative 
  projects, or setting and achieving ambitious 
  goals, I believe in bringing energy and dedication 
  to every aspect of life. My approach combines curiosity, 
  collaboration, and a drive to make an impact in everything I do.</p>
